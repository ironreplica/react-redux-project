This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# React Redux Project

This was built for the React Redux Youtube Tutorial Project for the Computer Programming module. My changes were that I added a custom slider to adjust the increment value, and a header that updates with the slider. I also added some styling to make it all look better.

## Getting Started

Clone the project, run `npm install`, after installing run `npm start`.

### Prerequisites

Visual Studio Code, NodeJS and NPM Packages.

This project was built with bootstrap, npm, react, and redux.
